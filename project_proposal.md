### Relevance:
  In the lending industry, interest rates are crucial in determining the riskiness of the borrower. Interest rates are paramount to banks and investors for generating fair income, serve as a backbone for the economy, and are signals for the well-being of the U.S. consumer. Inaccurate interest rates can cost businesses and banks millions of dollars, therefore correctly assessing borrowers is of vital importance. Due to the crucial role of loans in the American economic system, there is a large amount of public data available to analyze. Through the analysis of this data, we aim to answer the following questions:
  
  1. What is the ideal interest rate for a given loan?
  2. At what price is a given loan an intelligent investment?
  <br/>

We plan to focus on both the loan originators (offering interest rates) and the investors (what should the price of a loan be). Marketplace lending offers approximately 150 different fields with each loan including: FICO score, employment history, zip code, homeownership, debt history, etc. These fields, along with  external data collected for geographic reasons enable significant insight into the correct interest rate and sale value of each individual loan. <br/>

### Data:<br/>

  We will be working with the data set *All Lending Club Loan Data* from Kaggle, which contains 2007 through 2019 Lending Club accepted and rejected loan data. Our analysis will focus on the file for accepted loans, which contains approximately 150 fields regarding features of each loan. We will also be using a data dictionary to specify which fields are visible to investors. In addition, we will utilize geographic data obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve of Economic Data.
